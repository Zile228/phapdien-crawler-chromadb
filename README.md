# PhapDien Web Scraper & ChromaDB Vector Search

## Introduction

This repository contains my submission for the **ISODS George Washington Institute of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence - NLP and Data Science Internship & Volunteership 2025-2026** entrance test. 

The project includes:
- A **Python script** for scraping legal documents from the **BoPhapDienDienTu** dataset.
- A **Jupyter notebook** for processing and storing the documents in a **vector database** using ChromaDB and LangChain.
- A **Jupyter notebook** for performing **semantic search** on the vector database.

Since this is my first time working with **web scraping, vector databases, and semantic search**, I approached the challenge with curiosity and dedication. While I may not have prior experience in these areas, I have done my best to complete the task to the best of my ability. I truly appreciate the opportunity to learn and demonstrate my skills.
